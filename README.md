# vin-engine
A custom game engine made with passion. currently working on it.  
First made for Visual Novel, but i hope i'll be able to continue afterward for a more complete engine.

## Building VIN 
To build VIN you will need CMAKE and PYTHON.  
Install both if not already installed.  
  
Clone the repository : ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/HITOA/vin-engine.git```   
   
Install jinj2 package : ```pip install jinj2```   
Generate with cmake : ```cmake -B"./build" .```
